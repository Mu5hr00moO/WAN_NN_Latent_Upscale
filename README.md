> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This project is actively being developed. Current models work but we're training improved versions for better quality!

A universal neural network latent upscaler that supports **SD1.5**, **SDXL**, **Flux**, and **Wan2.2** models. Uses trained neural networks instead of simple interpolation for higher quality latent upscaling.

**Built upon the excellent foundation of [Ttl's ComfyUi_NNLatentUpscale](https://github.com/Ttl/ComfyUi_NNLatentUpscale)** - this project extends the original work with universal model support and improved architectures.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Universal Support**: Works with SD1.5, SDXL, Flux, and Wan2.2 models
- 🧠 **Neural Network Upscaling**: Significantly better quality than bilinear interpolation
- ⚙️ **Configurable Scale Factor**: 1.0x to 2.0x upscaling with smooth interpolation
- 🔄 **Automatic Model Loading**: Automatically detects and loads the correct model for each architecture
- 💾 **Memory Efficient**: Smart model loading/unloading to save VRAM
- 🎨 **Custom Wan2.2 Model**: Includes our own trained Wan2.2 upscaler (more models coming!)
- 🔧 **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for standard latent upscaling

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Git Clone (Recommended)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Model not found** | Models auto-download on first use. Check internet connection. |
| **CUDA out of memory** | Reduce batch size in workflow or use CPU mode |
| **Wrong model selected** | Ensure latent type matches selected model (check channels) |
| **Slow performance** | Enable GPU acceleration, check CUDA installation |
| **Quality issues** | Try different scale factors, ensure correct model type |

### Debug Mode:
```python
# In nn_upscale.py, set:
force_reload = True  # Reloads model on every execution
```
